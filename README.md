## Overview

This [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) plugin is a fork of the official [@semantic-release/github](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@semantic-release/github) plugin. It allows you to specify the `repositoryUrl` (normally inferred from `package.json`) as a configuration parameter. This opens the door to being able to publish with multiple plugins that rely on different values for `repositoryUrl`. [semantic-release-config](https://github.com/ProfessorManhattan/semantic-release-config) uses this plugin to publish to GitLab Releases and GitHub Releases from within the same flow.

<a href="#requirements" style="width:100%"><img style="width:100%" src="https://gitlab.com/megabyte-labs/assets/-/raw/master/png/aqua-divider.png" /></a>

## Requirements

If you are simply including this library in your project, all you need is a recent version of Node.js. **[Node.js >14.18.0](repository.project.node)** is sometimes required and is the only version range we actively support. Albeit, it is highly probable that lower versions will work as well depending on the requirements that this project imports.

### Developer Requirements

The following versions of Node.js and Python are required for development:

- **[Node.js >14.18.0](repository.project.node)**
- **[Python >3.10.0](repository.project.python)**

Other versions may work, but only the above versions are supported. Most development dependencies are installed automatically by our `Taskfile.yml` set-up (even Node.js and Python). Run `bash start.sh` to install **[Bodega](https://github.com/ProfessorManhattan/Bodega)** (an improved fork of [go-task](https://github.com/go-task/task)) and run the initialization sequence. The taskfiles will automatically install dependencies as they are needed, based on what development tasks you are running. For more information, check out the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ProfessorManhattan/semantic-release-gh/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) or simply run:

```shell
npm run help
```

`npm run help` will ensure Bodega is installed and then open an interactive dialog where you can explore and learn about various developer commands.

| `publish`          | Publish a [GitHub release](https://help.github.com/articles/about-releases), optionally uploading file assets.                                                                                                                           |

<a href="#usage" style="width:100%"><img style="width:100%" src="https://gitlab.com/megabyte-labs/assets/-/raw/master/png/aqua-divider.png" /></a>

## Usage

The plugin can be configured in the [**semantic-release** configuration file](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md#configuration):

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
    [
      "semantic-release-github",
      {
        "repositoryUrl": "https://github.com/professormanhattan/semantic-release-github",
        "assets": [
          { "path": "dist/asset.min.css", "label": "CSS distribution" },
          { "path": "dist/asset.min.js", "label": "JS distribution" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

With this example [GitHub releases](https://help.github.com/articles/about-releases) will be published with the file `dist/asset.min.css` and `dist/asset.min.js`.

## Configuration

### GitHub authentication

The GitHub authentication configuration is **required** and can be set via [environment variables](#environment-variables).

Follow the [Creating a personal access token for the command line](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) documentation to obtain an authentication token. The token has to be made available in your CI environment via the `GH_TOKEN` environment variable. The user associated with the token must have push permission to the repository.

When creating the token, the **minimum required scopes** are:

- [`repo`](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo) for a private repository
- [`public_repo`](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=public_repo) for a public repository

_Notes on GitHub Actions:_ You can use the default token which is provided in the secret _GITHUB_TOKEN_. However releases done with this token will NOT trigger release events to start other workflows.
If you have actions that trigger on newly created releases, please use a generated token for that and store it in your repository's secrets (any other name than GITHUB_TOKEN is fine).

When using the _GITHUB_TOKEN_, the **minimum required permissions** are:

- `contents: write` to be able to publish a GitHub release
- `issues: write` to be able to comment on released issues
- `pull-requests: write` to be able to comment on released pull requests

### Environment variables

#### assets

Can be a [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer) or and `Array` of
[globs](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer) and `Object`s with the following properties:

| Property | Description                                                                                              | Default                              |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `path`   | **Required.** A [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer) to identify the files to upload. | -                                    |
| `name`   | The name of the downloadable file on the GitHub release.                                                 | File name extracted from the `path`. |
| `label`  | Short description of the file displayed on the GitHub release.                                           | -                                    |

Each entry in the `assets` `Array` is globbed individually. A [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer)
can be a `String` (`"dist/**/*.js"` or `"dist/mylib.js"`) or an `Array` of `String`s that will be globbed together
(`["dist/**", "!**/*.css"]`).

If a directory is configured, all the files under this directory and its children will be included.

The `name` and `label` for each assets are generated with [Lodash template](https://lodash.com/docs#template). The following variables are available:

| Parameter     | Description                                                                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `branch`      | The branch from which the release is done.                                          |
| `lastRelease` | `Object` with `version`, `gitTag` and `gitHead` of the last release.                |
| `nextRelease` | `Object` with `version`, `gitTag`, `gitHead` and `notes` of the release being done. |
| `commits`     | `Array` of commit `Object`s with `hash`, `subject`, `body` `message` and `author`.  |

**Note**: If a file has a match in `assets` it will be included even if it also has a match in `.gitignore`.

##### assets examples

`'dist/*.js'`: include all the `js` files in the `dist` directory, but not in its sub-directories.

`[['dist', '!**/*.css']]`: include all the files in the `dist` directory and its sub-directories excluding the `css`
files.

`[{path: 'dist/MyLibrary.js', label: 'MyLibrary JS distribution'}, {path: 'dist/MyLibrary.css', label: 'MyLibrary CSS distribution'}]`: include the `dist/MyLibrary.js` and `dist/MyLibrary.css` files, and label them `MyLibrary JS distribution` and `MyLibrary CSS distribution` in the GitHub release.

`[['dist/**/*.{js,css}', '!**/*.min.*'], {path: 'build/MyLibrary.zip', label: 'MyLibrary'}]`: include all the `js` and
`css` files in the `dist` directory and its sub-directories excluding the minified version, plus the
`build/MyLibrary.zip` file and label it `MyLibrary` in the GitHub release.

`[{path: 'dist/MyLibrary.js', name: 'MyLibrary-${nextRelease.gitTag}.js', label: 'MyLibrary JS (${nextRelease.gitTag}) distribution'}]`: include the file `dist/MyLibrary.js` and upload it to the GitHub release with name `MyLibrary-v1.0.0.js` and label `MyLibrary JS (v1.0.0) distribution` which will generate the link:

> `[MyLibrary JS (v1.0.0) distribution](MyLibrary-v1.0.0.js)`

Dear Awesome Person,<br/><br/>
I create open source projects out of love. Although I have a job, shelter, and as much fast food as I can handle, it would still be pretty cool to be appreciated by the community for something I have spent a lot of time and money on. Please consider sponsoring me! Who knows? Maybe I will be able to quit my job and publish open source full time.
<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>
